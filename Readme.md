About Hangman
Going back to our old school days, some of the pen-paper games were always a top for our leisure time. Hangman was one, other than some chit games, to guess words according to the guesses determined and as soon as they lost all their wrong guesses, they were hanged (not really, but on paper ðŸ˜‰). That is an old way, now to play Hangman. The new advancement in technologies allows us to play hangman using our own computer also without any other player. How? Letâ€™s find out further

Python Hangman Project
The objective of our project is to implement the hangman game using Python. It doesnâ€™t require any specific modules other than random and time. Python loops and functions are enough to build this game here.

Project Prerequisites
This project requires good knowledge of Python which includes defining functions and managing for/while loops. The functions that we use here contain arguments that are defined in a global scope which can be further used in other functions to improve game quality. It can also be used to provide different steps when required to execute upon conditions by the for and while loops.

Project File Structure
First, letâ€™s check the steps to build the Hangman game in Python:

Importing the random and time modules.
Defining functions with specific global arguments.
Implementing loops to execute the program.
Passing the function in the program to run.
